Port mapping is used to connect an application running inside a Docker container to the host machine so that it can be accessed from outside the container. The container has its own isolated network, and the FHIR server inside it listens on an internal port (for example, 8080). When we run the container with a command such as -p 8080:8080, Docker creates a rule that forwards traffic from port 8080 on the host machine to port 8080 inside the container. The first number represents the host port, and the second represents the container port. As a result, when a user enters http://localhost:8080 in a browser on the host machine, the request is automatically bridged through Docker’s virtual network to the FHIR server running inside the container. This mechanism allows the containerized application to remain isolated while still being reachable from the host through the specified mapped port.
