The proposed system successfully transforms unstructured RMHC field data into standardized, interoperable clinical information using the FHIR framework. By implementing Docker-based HAPI FHIR infrastructure, FHIR Shorthand profiles, ConceptMap-based terminology translation, and a Python ETL pipeline, the solution ensures that raw community health records are validated, semantically harmonized, and stored in a scalable FHIR server.

This approach moves beyond simple data storage and enables true interoperability, allowing the same dataset to be reused across analytics platforms, public health reporting systems, and clinical decision-support applications. The use of transaction bundles, strict validation, and UUID linkage ensures referential integrity and patient-centric data representation.

The system provides a strong foundation for population health management, especially for monitoring chronic diseases in rural communities. It supports early detection, risk stratification, and longitudinal follow-up of patients through standardized observations and conditions.

Overall, the project demonstrates that:

fragmented RMHC datasets can be converted into interoperable digital health records

FHIR standards can be practically applied in rural and community health settings
